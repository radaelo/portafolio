And cibersecurity¿,
As a Systems Engineer with over 10 years of experience managing and fortifying complex IT infrastructures, I have extensive experience with cybersecurity. My expertise includes implementing hardening protocols, managing firewalls (pfSense, FortiGate, Cloudflare WAF), and proactive monitoring with tools like Zabbix and Wazuh.

I am familiar with various cybersecurity best practices such as ISO 27001, which I have implemented in my previous roles to ensure the protection of critical data through advanced backup/recovery solutions (EMC Networker, Dell Data Domain). I also have experience with vulnerability detection and threat hunting using tools like Zabbix and Wazuh.

In my previous roles, I have implemented network segmentation and access audits to ensure operational security in hybrid environments (Azure VMs, VMware ESXi). I have also managed secure storage on EMC Dell Data Domain with integrity controls and WORM for financial data.,
